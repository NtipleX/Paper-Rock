# Paper-Rock
My socket based mini game using "winsock2", "qt".
To run this - you have to start 'Server.exe' first. Once it's been done, it is waiting for 2 sockets to be connected with.
To connect to the server - run 'Paper2.exe' for the first client, and second for the another client to play with. After it,
game starts immediately (i.g.: there are no any waitings for turns, you are interacting in real time)
